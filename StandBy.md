## What files are stored in the "Standby" folder?

- All files that require other file modification in order to be compilable.
- Different data structure implementations.

***

### Dependence on external modification

Example:
[Binary_Tree_Traversal.c] file is compilable only if Stack and Queue element_type is changed from "int" to "Btree".

### Different Implementations of Data Structures

These files can be swapped with other implementation of the same data structure.
